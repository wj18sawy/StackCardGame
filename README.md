USER INSTRUCTIONS:

    This is a card game much like uno. The objective of the game is to be the first to get rid of all of the cards in your hand.
    
    The only way to get rid of a card or multiple cards is to play them onto the discard pile (a.k.a. the stack). In order to play a card or multiple cards you must play a card(s) who's value is higher or equal to the last card on the stack. The ranking of those cards from lowest value to highest is just like in poker, Three -> Ace.
    
    If you have two or more of the same card you can play them at the same time, as long as the card value is higher or equal to that on the stack. So for example if the top card on the stack was an eight, I could play single, double, triple, or quadruple of any card equal to or higher than an eight (eight, nine, ten, jack, queen, king, ace). Although if the last person to go played a multiple of cards you have to play the same amount of cards or greater. For example if the computer played two six's you'd have to play double, triple, or quadruple of a card with a value equal to or greater than six. 
    
    If the last card(s) you play can't be beat by the other player(s) the stack gets reset when it's your turn and you can play anything you want. If a user can't play a card or cards greater than what's on the stack they must draw one card from the deck. After drawing a card a user can play that card if it's playable or choose to end their turn. The deck is also reset once a two or joker is played. For this programs purposes you choose a two or joker, press play card(s), and then you automatically start a new turn. After the two or joker is played you can play any card(s) from your hand you would like. 
    
How To Draw a Card: Press on the deck to the right of the stack, you can only draw one hand per turn. 

How To Play a Card: Select the card(s) in your hand and if they are higher than the card on the stack they will fade in contrast to show    you have selected them. After selecting the card(s) you wish to play press play card(s). If you played a two or joker you will be        allowed to select card(s) and play them again. Other then that, you press the done button to end your turn and the computer's turn      will occur. 
                        
    The Information Box: The information box to the left of the stack pile shows the what card(s) were played on the last turn and who played them. There is also a x2, x3, or x4 symbol on the right upper corner of the stack pile if on the last turn a multiple of cards were played. 
                         
    As explained the first person to empty their hand wins the game, and then the new game button will appear and allow the user to play a new game.
